# Quixx
THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Why am I undertaking this project? My girlfriend's family treasures this game and I think besides one lucky win I can never quite figure out what the best strategy is. Time to use math to get that win % up.

## Quixx Rules
This personal project analyzes best strategies for Quixx: a dice game where you try to maximize your score before the game abruptly ends. The suggested amount of players is 2-5. Each player is given a card that looks something like this:

<span style="color:red;">2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 | 12 ðŸ”’> </span>
<span style="color:yellow;">2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 | 12 ðŸ”’> </span>
<span style="color:green;">12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 | 2 ðŸ”’> </span>
<span style="color:blue;">12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 | 2 ðŸ”’> </span>
